## Overview
The product preview card is a newbie level challenge on Front end mentor. I have been trying to practice my CSS skill to improve the knowledge that i currently have.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size (Breakpoint set on 40em)
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (Almost)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned few techniques in using the Display flex, i struggled on how i can have equal width for both flex items of my card class. 



### Continued development

Would probably make the font-sizes different on each breakpoints.
Will probably also try using Sass for this. Although the project is still very simple IMO.
